The three simulation setups can be reconstructed by running the separate files

- S1: call_s1.R
- S2: call_s2.R
- S3: call_s3.R

In order to reconstruct the results, the code 

- evaluation.R 

has to be run. Please note that this code has to be run separately for all three models, since it refers to the lists constructed in each setup.
