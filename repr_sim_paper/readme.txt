The three simulation setups can be reconstructed by running the separate files
- S1: call_sim_submission.R
- S2: call_sim_submission_pgN.R
- S3: call_sim_submission_pgn.R

In order to reconstruct the results, the code in evaluation.R has to be run. 
Please note that this code has to be run separately for all three models, 
since it refers to the lists constructed in each setup.
